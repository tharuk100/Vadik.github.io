        <h1>Description</h1>
        The domesticated saffron crocus, Crocus sativus, is an autumn-flowering
         perennial plant unknown in the wild. It probably descends from the 
         eastern Mediterranean autumn-flowering Crocus cartwrightianus which 
         is also known as "wild saffron"[15] and originated in Crete or Central
          Asia.[16] C. thomasii and C. pallasii are other possible sources.[17]
          [18] As a genetically monomorphic clone,[16] it slowly propagated
           throughout much of Eurasia.

It is a sterile triploid form, which means that three
 homologous sets of chromosomes make up each specimen's 
 genetic complement; C. sativus bears eight chromosomal 
 bodies per set, making for 24 in total.[19] Being sterile,
  the purple flowers of C. sativus fail to produce viable seeds; 
  reproduction hinges on human assistance: clusters of corms, underground,
   bulb-like, starch-storing organs, must be dug up, divided, and replanted.
    A corm survives for one season, producing via vegetative division up to ten 
    "cormlets" that can grow into new plants in the next season.[20] The compact
     corms are small, brown globules that can measure as large as 5 cm (2 in) in
      diameter, have a flat base, and are shrouded in a dense mat of parallel 
      fibres; this coat is referred to as the "corm tunic". Corms also bear
       vertical fibres, thin and net-like, that grow up to 5 cm (2 in) above 
       the plant's neck.[19]

The plant sprouts 5–11 white and non-photosynthetic leaves known as cataphylls. These membrane-like structures cover and protect 5 to 11 true leaves as they bud and develop on the crocus flower. The latter are thin, straight, and blade-like green foliage leaves, which are 1–3 mm (1⁄32–1⁄8 in), in diameter, which either expand after the flowers have opened ("hysteranthous") or do so simultaneously with their blooming ("synanthous"). C. sativus cataphylls are suspected by some to manifest prior to blooming when the plant is irrigated relatively early in the growing season. Its floral axes, or flower-bearing structures, bear bracteoles, or specialised leaves, that sprout from the flower stems; the latter are known as pedicels.[19] After aestivating in spring, the plant sends up its true leaves, each up to 40 cm (16 in) in length. Only in October, after most other flowering plants have released their seeds, do its brilliantly hued flowers develop; they range from a light pastel shade of lilac to a darker and more striated mauve.[21] The flowers possess a sweet, honey-like fragrance. Upon flowering, the plants are 20–30 cm (8–12 in) in height and bear up to four flowers. A three-pronged style 25–30 mm (1–1+3⁄16 in) in length, emerges from each flower. Each prong terminates with a vivid crimson stigma, which are the distal end of a carpel.[20][19]


<div class="cul">
    <h1>Cultivation</h1>
    <hr color="black">
    The saffron crocus, unknown in the wild, probably descends from Crocus cartwrightianus. It is a triploid that is "self-incompatible" and male sterile; it undergoes aberrant meiosis and is hence incapable of independent sexual reproduction—all propagation is by vegetative multiplication via manual "divide-and-set" of a starter clone or by interspecific hybridisation.[22][17]

Crocus sativus thrives in the Mediterranean maquis, an ecotype superficially resembling the North American chaparral, and similar climates where hot and dry summer breezes sweep semi-arid lands. It can nonetheless survive cold winters, tolerating frosts as low as −10 °C (14 °F) and short periods of snow cover.[20][23] Irrigation is required if grown outside of moist environments such as Kashmir, where annual rainfall averages 1,000–1,500 mm (40–60 in); saffron-growing regions in Greece (500 mm or 20 in annually) and Spain (400 mm or 16 in) are far drier than the main cultivating Iranian regions. What makes this possible is the timing of the local wet seasons; generous spring rains and drier summers are optimal. Rain immediately preceding flowering boosts saffron yields; rainy or cold weather during flowering promotes disease and reduces yields. Persistently damp and hot conditions harm the crops,[24] and rabbits, rats, and birds cause damage by digging up corms. Nematodes, leaf rusts, and corm rot pose other threats. Yet Bacillus subtilis inoculation may provide some benefit to growers by speeding corm growth and increasing stigma biomass yield.[25]

The plants fare poorly in shady conditions; they grow best in full sunlight. Fields that slope towards the sunlight are optimal (i.e., south-sloping in the Northern Hemisphere). Planting is mostly done in June in the Northern Hemisphere, where corms are lodged 7–15 cm (3–6 in) deep; its roots, stems, and leaves can develop between October and February.[19] Planting depth and corm spacing, in concert with climate, are critical factors in determining yields. Mother corms planted deeper yield higher-quality saffron, though form fewer flower buds and daughter corms. Italian growers optimise thread yield by planting 15 cm (6 in) deep and in rows 2–3 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄4 in) apart; depths of 8–10 cm (3–4 in) optimise flower and corm production. Greek, Moroccan, and Spanish growers employ distinct depths and spacings that suit their locales.

C. sativus prefers friable, loose, low-density, well-watered, and well-drained clay-calcareous soils with high organic content. Traditional raised beds promote good drainage. Soil organic content was historically boosted via application of some 20–30 tonnes per hectare (9–13 short tons per acre) of manure. Afterwards, and with no further manure application, corms were planted.[26] After a period of dormancy through the summer, the corms send up their narrow leaves and begin to bud in early autumn. Only in mid-autumn do they flower. Harvests are by necessity a speedy affair: after blossoming at dawn, flowers quickly wilt as the day passes.[27] All plants bloom within a window of one or two weeks.[28] Stigmas are dried quickly upon extraction and (preferably) sealed in airtight containers.[29]

    <h1>Harvesting</h1>
    <hr color="back">
    The high retail value of saffron is maintained on world markets because of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some 440,000 hand-picked saffron stigmas per kilogram (200,000 stigmas/lb) – equivalently, 150,000 crocus flowers per kilogram (70,000 flowers/lb).[10][12][30][31] Forty hours of labour are needed to pick 150,000 flowers.[32]

One freshly picked crocus flower yields on average 30 mg of fresh saffron or 7 mg dried; roughly 150 flowers yield 1 g (1⁄32 oz) of dry saffron threads; to produce 12 g (7⁄16 oz) of dried saffron, 450 g (1 lb) of flowers are needed; the yield of dried spice from fresh saffron is only 13 g/kg (0.2 oz/lb).[26]

            Saffron is a powerful spice high in antioxidants. 
            It has been linked to health benefits, such as improved mood,
             libido, and sexual function, as well as reduced PMS symptoms and 
             enhanced weight loss. Best of all, it's generally safe for
